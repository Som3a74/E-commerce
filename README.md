🚀 New Project 🚀

Hello everyone! 👋 I’m excited to announce the launch of my latest project: an e-commerce platform built from the ground up using Next.js and a range of cutting-edge technologies! 💻

🌟 What’s Inside:

⚡️ Performance-Driven: Powered by Next.js with server-side rendering, ensuring blazing-fast performance and top-notch SEO optimization.

💼 Advanced UI Components: Designed with TailwindCSS and shadcn UI, delivering a sleek, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

🎨 Effortless Theme Switching: Switch seamlessly between light and dark modes.

💳 Stripe Integration: Seamlessly integrate payments with Stripe.

📦 Optimized Carousel: Smooth product browsing with the React Slick Carousel.

💬 Interactive Toaster Notifications: Enhanced user feedback with Sonner for beautiful toast messages.

🔒 Secure Routes: Best practices for route protection using middleware, with user data stored securely via universal-cookie.

📝 Form Handling & Validation: Powered by React Hook Form and Zod for smooth input handling and validation.

⚙️ State Management: Managed efficiently with Context API.

🔍 Behind the Scenes:

I focused on clean code and best practices:

✅ Reusable components for maintainable and scalable code.

✅ Following the DRY principle to avoid redundancy.

✅ Lazy loading components with next/dynamic for enhanced performance and SEO.

✅ Using next/script to minimize main-thread work.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
